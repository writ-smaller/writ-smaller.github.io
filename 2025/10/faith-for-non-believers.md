# Faith for Non-Believers

* I have reason to believe the word "faith" has been misunderstood by both believers and non-believers alike and the meaning has slowly drifted over time from its original intent in religious texts.
* I think most serious and critical religious scholars already understand this.
* And I think our modern usage of the word "faith" which incorrectly renders it into "believing without evidence" has done an untold amount of damage to both religious, secular, moral, societal, philosophical ***and*** scientific discourse.
* Instead faith originally meant something closer to faithfulness or fidelity
    * But even that doesn't do it justice


## Introduction

* If you're a non-believer
    * I want to let you know that I've spent a good portion of my life as a ***strong*** non-believer, 
rejecting the idea that faith was a virtue.  
    * I've had a change of heart on my view of faith, but it's not for the reasons 
you might think.

* If you
    * I was so committed to defaulting to 
    non-belief that I didn't want to call myself an atheist, because that felt like 
    it might imply that I was certain God does not exist.  
    * The only reason I preferred to call myself an agnostic was that I wanted to
    clear to the person listening to me that they understood that ***I do not like to make claims of certainty*** about things I cannot prove.

## Who Am I?

I understand *precisely* why non-believers (athiests, agnostics, etc.) do not 
value faith.  As someone whose life was changed by Carl Sagan's book "The 
Demon-Haunted World, Science as a Candle in the Dark", I found tremendous 
comfort in having a boloney-detection kit and being able to tell myself, "I 
don't have to believe in anything without evidence."

While believers and gnostic athiests might argue their points for why they assert a God
exists or does not exist, not only did I tell myself, "I don't know either way", 
I thought I was superior to both the believers and the non-believers because I 
was the only one who was actually being rational and evidence-based.

Sometime in the last 15 years, Christians started accusing non-believers of 
believing in science, or claiming that science is their faith.  While some 
athiests liked to argue that science isn't a belief system or that their beliefs
were justified by evidence, I took an approach out of Carl Sagan's book and 
would say, "I don't *believe* in anything (regardless of evidence or lack 
thereof)" because I took a quasi-statistical approach to knowledge and truth 
that resembles more of a sports-gambling mindset than a faith-based one.  In my 
mind, I was just betting on the most likely outcome based on the evidence at 
hand.  I made it a point to make a distinction between my bet and what I 
actually know to be true.

And seeing how there is a non-zero chance that this is all a simulation, I was 
ok to slap bookie-style odds on everything.

If you're a non-believer reading this, and you think your commitment to 
non-belief is stronger than mine, I am going to be inclined to disagree simply
because I have spent decades committing myself to this idea.

## My Non-Apology and Motivation

What I’m about to say might sound like heresy. Maybe it is. It might make believers uneasy because it sounds like I’m watering down something sacred. It might make non-believers uneasy because it sounds like I’m trying to smuggle religion back into the conversation. But bear with me.

The word *faith* doesn’t mean what most of us think it means. Somewhere along the way, it got distorted—dragged out of its original context and turned into a litmus test for belief. “Do you have faith?” became shorthand for “Do you believe in God?” But in the Hebrew scriptures, the word we translate as *faith*—**emunah**—doesn’t mean belief at all. It means *fidelity*. It means *trustworthiness*. It’s the quality of being reliable, steady, and loyal.

Faith, in its original sense, is not an opinion you hold. It's not a proposition you affirm. It’s a relationship you keep. It’s the glue that holds a promise together. Belief may grow out of that, but it’s a byproduct—not the focal point. The focal point is fidelity.

And here’s where I want to talk to both camps—the believer and the non-believer—without hedging or talking out of both sides of my mouth. Because this isn’t a message for one group or the other. It’s for both. If you’re a believer, you might say your faith is in God—the source of goodness, the one who calls you to be faithful. If you’re a non-believer, you can still practice fidelity. You can pledge your trust to goodness itself—to truth, to compassion, to the fragile work of keeping promises and building trust in a world that keeps breaking it.

That’s what faith *is*: the practice of fidelity. It’s what makes relationships work, what holds communities together, what allows civilization to function. You don’t need supernatural belief for that. You just need to show up for one another in good faith.

The tragedy of our time is that we’ve reduced “faith” to something tribal and propositional. We treat it as a badge that separates “us” from “them.” We build our little belief silos and argue about who’s right. But none of that matters if we can’t keep faith with each other—if we can’t be trusted, if we can’t honor truth, if we can’t love with loyal kindness (*ḥesed*).

We don’t need to erase our differences in belief. What we need is to recover the virtue that used to anchor them—the virtue of fidelity. That’s what *emunah* meant. That’s what the prophets meant when they said, “The righteous shall live by faith.” They weren’t talking about dogma. They were talking about steadfastness.

If we could relearn that—if we could practice fidelity again—our divisions wouldn’t magically disappear, but they’d lose their power to tear us apart. Because faith, understood rightly, isn’t about what you believe or don’t believe. It’s about whether you can be trusted to keep the promises that make us human.

This keeps your moral edge intact but gives the piece a rhythm:

* **Paragraph 1:** Stakes and tone (this might sound like heresy).
* **2–3:** Redefinition (faith = fidelity, not belief).
* **4:** Equal address to both believers and non-believers.
* **5–6:** The cultural diagnosis (faith lost to tribal belief).
* **7:** The hopeful close (recovering fidelity).

Would you like me to write the next pass with a bit more of your *spoken* rhythm—less essay-like, more conversational, like how you’d read it aloud in the blog format?
